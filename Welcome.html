            <b>The Fitzpatrick Group</b> asked
            <a href="https://covertmktg.com" target="_blank"><b>Covert Marketing</b></a
            >, to help us differentiate ourselves in the financial services industry. We do not
            believe in the marketing concepts of typical financial services firms. The cliché
            depiction of an elderly couple walking down the beach unfortunately has become the
            exception not the norm. Even individuals that are doing well with their retirement
            savings, often believe there is a better, more efficient way. The retirement statistics
            of our time do not paint a pretty picture and many individuals are misguided by
            overzealous marketing campaigns, misleading averages, and faulty assumptions. Most would
            agree that the road to financial freedom has become shrouded by fees, confusing
            products, saturated competition, and large banking corruption. Perhaps the financial
            marketing should portray the elderly couple still working, while the industry, stock
            markets, and taxes gobble up the bulk of their wealth. The good news is there is a
            better way.

            The loading page or journey starts with a <b>Speed Read</b>,
            <b>“Welcome to a New Realm of Financial Understanding”</b>. The
            <b>Speed Read</b> concept, created by Jaie Locke, is fascinating. It represents your
            ability to handle the content. Studies show that your brain can pick up words and
            sentences in phrases even if we multiplied the speed 10x. At
            <b>The Fitzpatrick Group</b> we believe in education. We believe you can understand your
            finances, various products, the markets, taxes, fees and costs, and strategy, given the
            proper time and resources. Too many industries do better when you, the consumer,
            understand less. Your financial future, and financial services, should not be one of
            those industries. By changing the color of one letter in the <b>Speed Read</b>, you
            brain remembers and picks up the additional letters and words. It also retains the
            information better. At <b>The Fitzpatrick Group</b>, we try to focus on simplicity and
            retention of key words and concepts as we work with our clients, such as:
            <b><i>Volatility, Fees, and Taxes</i></b
            >. This, we believe, allows you to develop a lifetime strategy that focuses on
            simplicity and efficiency. The <b>Speed Read</b> also represents the world we live in.
            This is an information age, and the information is coming at all of us very quickly.
            <b><i>Content</i></b> or information today must be simplified, direct, and educational,
            to be retained. The current financial services industry is anything but. The current
            state of finance is over-complicated, misleading, and relies solely on advisors
            pretending to be smarter than their clients. We hope the <b>Speed Read</b> gives you a
            sense of what you are capable of, what you can pick up and retain very quickly.

            It is with this mindset that the graphics and colors of the website were chosen. The
            dark back drop and clouds depicts the current state of financial services, dangerous,
            unclear, ominous… a sense of void amidst the overabundance of products and advisor fees
            and services. Are you at all clear on how your retirement and/or portfolio will perform?
            What degree of certainty would you associate with your current plan? The dark clouds on
            the horizon represent an oncoming <b>Storm</b>. We believe that the financial arena is
            headed toward a storm of its own. The political arena, legislative risk, increasing tax
            risk, ever increasing market volatility, globalization, and corruption, constantly
            challenge and impact the status of your retirement portfolio. While there is no way to
            eliminate all risk from a strategy, we believe the goal should be to try. The current
            state of financial affairs exacerbates these risks and does little to protect you from
            their pitfalls. We hope and trust that the dark backdrop did not deter you from our
            <b><i>Content</i></b>
            and in a way aligns with some of your concerns and beliefs.

            <b>The Quick Approach</b> quickly brings us to a <b>Door</b> on our concrete
            <b>Pillar</b>. This <b>Door</b> represents your opportunity. Your opportunity for
            change, your opportunity for a solid strategy amidst the confusion and ominous financial
            environment. An opportunity provided by <b>The Fitzpatrick Group</b>. That said, you

            their current retirement strategy and often ask, “what else is out there, what else can
            I do…”? We can help, but you must choose. The ride to the top of the
            <b>Pillar</b> demonstrates the size and power of the strategies we explore. The
            strategies we educate on are not new, in fact they are the foundation of every great
            business, bank, and wealthy family across America. The certainty and power of these
            assets are reflected in the large <b>Pillar</b>. The light at the top is a beacon and
            calling that provides clarity through education. The stone construction is a symbol of
            foundation, strength, and the very essence of the earth and world we live in. The simple
            but powerful, the <b>Pillar</b> is a reminder, a calling, for people to go back to the
